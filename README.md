#this is my new facial recognition based project which was made with python and javascript and was deployed to a local HTML page,a new version will be uploaded on the 5th of november 2020, and I'll deploy the website to heroku so that you won't need to download the website and the libraries I'm using .
If you want to use the website locally, you'll have to downlload some libraries like flask and SQLalchemy and of course have python on your computer.
How to use:
Install all the libraries which are written in the requirement file, an option to do this is: pip freeze > requirements. txt
then open you command prompt, change the directory to where the app.py is located by typing cd /.../.../.../face_recognition (you can select the app.py and hit properties, then copy the location and paste it to the cmd)
and from now on type python app.py to run the app and open the link given in the command prompt in your website.
##if you have a compiler you can also open the python file and run it wherever you want...
#
the project is still in progress and it's not finished yet, in one week from now I will be uploading the full version.
